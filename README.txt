This is a Minecraft Datapack that announces the elapsed days each dawn.

The intent of this datapack is to help streamers and video let's play creators - 
keep track of the days in game in their series.

Minecraft trigger style customization command:
/trigger DayCount_Style

Using the command above once will trigger a new DayCounter Style. By triggering it twice a new DayCounter Style will appear as well as triggering it a third time.
There's only 3 different styles:
1. Chat Day Counter
2. Small Day Counter above the inventory hot-bar
3. Large Day Counter in the middle of the screen

If this Datapack is used in any other mode than Survival or Hardcore without cheats: It can fail Day Counter by a few. If any other mode is used and commands as "/time set night" as well as usage of bed before a full Minecraft day has passed by - the datapack will proceed to the next day even when the F3 menu says otherwise!
